# Shmup Tutorial Project

This project follows **Lazy Devs Academy's** YouTube series:  
🎥 [Make a Shoot 'Em Up in PICO-8](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk6y2JUVsU3f3uQXZbA4b6y5RdpYYtO0t)

## About

I’m recreating and expanding upon the lessons from Lazy Dev’s *Shoot 'Em Up Tutorial* playlist to understand:
- Core PICO-8 game structure (`_init`, `_update`, `_draw`)
- Player movement and shooting mechanics
- Enemy spawning and patterns
- Collision detection and scoring
- Simple menus and polish

This repo contains my working files:
- `shmup.p8` – main cartridge
- `/Shmup/` – supporting assets, sprites, and code snippets from each episode

## Tools
- **Engine:** [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php)  
- **Language:** Lua  
- **Editor:** VS Code + PICO-8 cartridge folder integration

## Goal

To learn clean, modular game design in PICO-8 by following Lazy Dev’s teaching style — then extend it into my own original project.
